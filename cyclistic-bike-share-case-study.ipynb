I’ll perform real-world tasks as a junior data analyst for a fictional company (Cyclistic bike-share). In order to answer key business question, I’ll follow the steps of data analysis process (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act).\n\n### About Cyclistic bike-share company:\nIn 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\nUntil now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n\n### Scenario:\nI’m a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, our team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, our team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n\n# 2- ASK:\n### Objective:\nDesign marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to achieve that three questions, need be answered\n* How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n* Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?\n* How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\n\n### Business task:\nHow do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n\n### Key stakeholders:\n* Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and my manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n* Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.\n* Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.\n\n# 3- Prepare:\n* the data located in divvy-tripdata divvy.\n* Data organized by month and year saved to CSV (comma separated values) file. In this case study I’m going to use 12 files from July 2022 through June 2023 each file contains columns named as follow (ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual) saved to My computer.\n* For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate so it’s ROCCC (reliable, original, comprehensive, current and cited).\n* The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license. privacy issues prohibit me from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that I won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Install required packages\n* install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n* install.packages(\"lubridate\")\n*
